# Collection of resources for web development

This is repositoy where i will be uploading snipets of code that have been modified to match my workflow and a list of plugins/code snipets, that have been tested in real projects. The plugins are for WordPress theme development

---

#### Front End
* Slider for content - [Owl Carousel v2](http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/)
* CSS animations - [Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) - the idea here is to import only the desired effect, not the whole css file... its just too much and its never used fully.
* Web Icons - [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/)
* Header scroll effect (sticky header) - [Headroom.js](https://github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js)

#### WordPress Plugins
* For creating contact forms of any kind: [Contact form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)

#### Collection of links
* How long is the content in "time to read" minutes - [readingTime.js](https://github.com/michael-lynch/reading-time)
* Best free stock photos site at the moment - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
* Great looking animated css framework. - [Materializecss](http://materializecss.com/collapsible.html) - Could be used for some free WP theme in future.
